## User Notification Management

### Toggling Notifications

Each user has a toggle button in the `/users` interface:

## Tips for Admins

### Categorizing Products
- **Respond quickly** - Users expect products to be browsable soon after posting
- **Be consistent** - Use the same subcategory for similar products
- **Don't skip** - All products should be categorized for best user experience

### Media Albums
- Albums (multiple photos/videos) are stored as ONE product
- The caption from the first message is used
- All photos/videos are shown when users view the product

### Managing Users
- Check `/users` periodically to see engagement
- High interaction count = active user
- Last seen shows recent activity

### Safety
- **Never use `/nuke` unless absolutely necessary**
- The double confirmation exists for a reason
- Consider backing up catalog.db before nuking
- **Deleted products leave channel messages intact** - you can manually clear channel messages if desired

### Uncategorized Products
- Use `/recategorize` to find products that weren't categorized
- Check regularly to ensure complete catalog
- Process in batches of 10 to avoid notification spam

## Troubleshooting

### Product not showing in category
- Verify product was categorized (check notification history)
- Try `/recategorize` to send new categorization request
- Check if product was accidentally deleted

### Too many notifications
- This is normal when backlog exists
- Use `/recategorize` to control flow (10 at a time)
- Categorize promptly to avoid backlog

### Users not tracked
- User tracking is automatic
- Users must send a message or use /start
- Just browsing catalog via buttons doesn't trigger tracking

### Media album showing as single photo
- Check if all photos arrived at same time
- Bot waits 1.5 seconds to collect album
- If photos sent separately, they're separate products
